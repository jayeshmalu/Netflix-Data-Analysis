# Netflix Data Analysis

The dataset I used for the Netflix data analytics project consists of TV shows and movies streamed on Netflix till year 2019. 

In this project, I will take a look at some very important models of Netflix data to understand whatâ€™s best for their business. Some of the most important tasks that we can analyze from Netflix data are:

1. Understand what content is available
2. Understand the similarities between the content
3. Understand the network between actors and directors
4. What exactly Netflix is focusing on
5. Sentiment analysis of content available on Netflix.


Also building a dashboards for analysis, soon using Python, Dash, Plotly
